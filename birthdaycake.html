<h1>Birthday Cake Recipe</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<h3>Dry:</h3>
<ul>
<li>2/3 cup Wholesome Foods organic brown sugar</li>
<li>2 tsp Hain's Featherweight aluminum-free/gluten-free baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp Bob's Red Mill xanthan gum</li>
<li>2 tsp unflavored gelatin</li>
<li>1/3 cup Bob's Red Mill organic amaranth flour</li>
<li>1/3 cup Bob's Red Mill organic coconut flour</li>
<li>1/3 cup Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour<li>
<li>1/3 cup Bob's Red Mill potato starch flour</li>
<br>
</ul>
<h3>Wet:</h3>
<ul>
<li>1/3 cup Spectrum Naturals organic shortening</li>
<li>1 tsp Flavorganics gluten-free vanilla</li>
<li>3 organic brown eggs (or substitute)</li>
<li>2/3 cup "milk" (1/3 cup Thai Kitchen organic coconut milk and 1/3 cup water)</li>
<li>2 Tbsp water</li>

<h2>Directions:</h2>
<br>
1.	Using mixer, combine all dry ingredients together.<br>
2.	Add shortening and blend in completely.<br>
3.	Add "milk," eggs or substitute, and vanilla.<br>
4.	Try not to over mix as xanthan gum can get pretty gummy.  If you need to add the extra water, do it one tablespoon at a time.  This dough is thicker, like a muffin batter, not runny. <br>
5.	Grease and amaranth flour a 9-inch cake pan.  This batter does great as cupcakes or small novelty shape cakes.<br>
6.	Bake for 35 minutes at 350 degrees.  20 minutes for cupcakes/novelty size cakes.<br>
7.	Cool on rack for 5-10 minutes before removing cake from pan.<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Note: I always make this cake fresh the day of the celebration.  It just tastes so much better fresh.  Once cool I sprinkle with powdered sugar, use fresh fruit, or accent with minimal frosting.   Once cool, be sure to cover and refrigerate any unused cake for later.</p>

<p>Chocolate Cake: Increase brown sugar to 1 cup and add 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder to the flours.</p>
