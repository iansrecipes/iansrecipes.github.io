<h1>Gluten/Dairy-Free/Yeast-Free Waffles</h1>
 
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
 
<ul>
<li>1 organic brown egg</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Thai Kitchen organic coconut milk</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Spectrum organic safflower oil</li>
<li>¼ cup water</li>
<li>¼ tsp Redmond’s sea salt</li>
<li>¼ tsp Featherweight aluminum-free/gluten-free baking powder</li>
<li>¼ tsp Simply Organic cinnamon</li>
<li>¼ cup Bob’s Red Mill organic amaranth flour</li>
<li>¼ cup Bob’s Red Mill tapioca flour</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Directions:</h2>
 
1. Preheat waffle iron.<br>
2. In a small bowl, mix egg, coconut milk, and oil until combined.<br>
3. Add water and combine.<br>
4. One ingredient at a time, add in amaranth flour, tapioca flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.<br>
5. If there are any lumps, smush out best you can.<br>
6. Put appropriate amount of batter into your iron and cook to desired crispiness.<br>
 
<h2>Note:</h2>
 
<p>I have a Cuisinart waffle maker.  For me, this recipe will make 2  - 7-1/2” diameter round waffles.  Up here in Estes, if I put it on setting 3-4 and let it beep at me once that it is done and then leave the waffle in there and then wait until it beeps at me again a little while later that it is done – then it is perfect!
 <br>
I make up about 8 little baggies of the dry ingredients at a time so that I always have them on hand.   It is a really quick and easy breakfast before school.  They taste good plain or with the traditional toppings.</p>
