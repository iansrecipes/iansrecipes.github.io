<h1>Gluten/Dairy-Free/Yeast-Free Waffles</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<ul>
<li>1 organic brown egg</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Thai Kitchen organic coconut milk</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Spectrum organic safflower oil</li>
<li>1/4 cup water</li>
<li>1/4 tsp Redmond's sea salt</li>
<li>1/4 tsp Featherweight aluminum-free/gluten-free baking powder</li>
<li>1/4 tsp Simply Organic cinnamon</li>
<li>1/4 cup Bob's Red Mill organic amaranth flour</li>
<li>1/4 cup Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions:</h2>

1. Preheat waffle iron.<br>
2. In a small bowl, mix egg, coconut milk, and oil until combined.<br>
3. Add water and combine.<br>
4. One ingredient at a time, add in amaranth flour, tapioca flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.<br>
5. If there are any lumps, smush out best you can.<br>
6. Put appropriate amount of batter into your iron and cook to desired crispiness.<br>

<h2>Note:</h2>

<p>I have a Cuisinart waffle maker.  For me, this recipe will make 2  - 7-1/2" diameter round waffles.  Up here in Estes, if I put it on setting 3-4 and let it beep at me once that it is done and then leave the waffle in there and then wait until it beeps at me again a little while later that it is done - then it is perfect!
 <br>
 <p>for extra crisp the way I like it, heat to setting 5 and allow the waffle to cook through about 5-6 beep cycles it will make crispy waffles.  If you want to be sure they are extra crispy, put the batter onto the irons right after the up to tempurature beep, and be sure it sizzles right from the start.</p>
I make up about 8 little baggies of the dry ingredients at a time so that I always have them on hand.   It is a really quick and easy breakfast before school.  They taste good plain or with the traditional toppings.</p>
