<h1>Gluten/Dairy-Free/Yeast-Free Hamburger or Hot Dog Buns</h1>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<ul>
<li>2 organic brown eggs</li>
<li>1/3 cup Spectrum safflower oil</li>
<li>1/2 cup "milk" (1/4 cup Thai Kitchen coconut milk & 1/4 cup water)</li><br>
<li>3/4 cup Bob's Red Mill white or brown rice flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill potato starch flour</li>
<li>1 Tbsp. Wholesome Sweetners organic evaporated cane juice sugar</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Redmond's sea salt</li>
<li>2 tsp Featherweight aluminum-free/gluten-free baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp Bob's Red Mill Xanthan gum</li>
<br><br>


<h2>Directions:</h2>

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.<br>
2. In one bowl mix wet ingredients.  In another bowl mix dry ingredients.<br>
3. Then mix all ingredients together.<br>
4. For burger buns - grease large muffin tins and fill about 1/2 full.<br>
5. Can top with sesame seeds if desired.<br>
6. Bake for 13-15 minutes or until nice and golden brown on top.<br>

<h3>Note:</h3>

<p>Try not to undercook or they fall when cooling and are gooey inside.  If you want hot dog buns, I just spooned out about 5" long oblong shapes onto cookie sheet and baked the same way.  They weren't perfectly shaped, though.   My sister has to bake like us, too and she bought a specialty mini bread baking pan that looks like a wave shape and it worked a lot better for nicer shaped buns.  These do freeze okay for using as you need.</p>
