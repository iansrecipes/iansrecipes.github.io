<h2>Oven-cooked filet mignon</h2>
<p>Get 1 1/2-2 inch thick filet mignon steaks to room temperature (about 30 min), and cover them heavily in course ground pepper and Morton's Kosher salt. Preheat the oven to 450&deg;. Using high heat safflower oil, get a skillet up to high heat and sear the steaks for four minutes on each side and then put the skillet in the oven to finish for 10-12 minutes. Then take the pan out and put it on the stovetop, put a couple pats of butter on each filet and cover the skillet on a cool burner to rest for five minutes. After that time I slice the steak and it will be a perfect medium/medium well. Be sure to spoon the brown butter that the pan creates over the steaks and finish with some truffle salt.</p><br>

<h2>Grilled filet mignon</h2>
<p>Get 1 1/2-2 inch thick filet mignon steaks to room temperature (about 30 min), and cover them heavily in course ground pepper and Morton's Kosher salt.  Start a fire on just one side of the grill and place a Himalayan salt block on the side without the fire.  Get the grill up to 375 - 400 degrees and put the steaks on the block.  Allow the steaks to smoke for about 60 - 80 minutes depending on the level of doneness you would like.  You poke at the steaks to determine their inner temperature.  When you do take them off the heat, be sure to allow the steaks to rest for at least five minutes.  Finish with truffle salt.</p>
