<h1>Gluten/Dairy-Free Sugar Cookies</h1><br>

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>

<ul>
<li>1/3 cup Purity Farms organic ghee (clarified butter)</li>
<li>1/3 cup Spectrum organic all vegetable shortening</li>
<li>1 tsp Flavorganics gluten-free vanilla</li>
<li>1 organic brown egg</li>
<li>2 Tbsp Thai Kitchen organic coconut milk</li>
<li>2 Tbsp water</li>
<li>3/4 Wholesome Foods organic cane sugar</li>
<li>1/4 tsp Redmond's sea salt</li>
<li>2 tsp Featherweight aluminum-free/gluten-free baking powder</li>
<li>1 tsp Bob's Red Mill xanthan gum</li>
<li>1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill organic amaranth flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill organic coconut flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill potato starch flour</li>
<li>Sprinked with India Tree sugar crystals (dyes derived from fruit/vegetables)</li></ul>

<h2>Directions:</h2>

1. Using mixer, whip shortening and ghee together then add vanilla and sugar.  Blend until creamy.<br>
2. Add egg, coconut milk, and water and blend together.<br>
3. Add sea salt, amaranth flour, and coconut flour and blend together.<br>
4. Turn of mixer and add tapioca flour, potato starch flour, baking powder, and xanthan gum.  Using spatula, carefully cut/fold these items together.  When clumpy, mix for very short time to fully combine, don't over mix.  If too dry add another 1/2-1 tsp water and mix.<br>
5. Let dough chill overnight.<br>
6. When ready to make cookies, allow dough to warm up slightly.  Lay out freezer paper.  Using hands, press out dough about 1/3 inch thick.  Cut out with desired cookie cutters.<br>
7. Decorate with sprinkles or sugar and cinnamon.<br>
8. Bake for 8-9 minutes at 375 degrees.<br>

<p>Note: Keep in mind that I live at 7,500 ft.  Depending on where you live, you may need to make small modifications.  Also too, coconut milk can be substituted for soy milk or nut milks.  Amaranth and coconut flours behave similar to rice flours but don't have that "gritty" texture that rice has.  I love coconut flour because it is sweet and doesn't have the strong flavor of most alternative flours.  The tapioca and potato starch are very light and fluffy flours, the closest substitute for them would be arrowroot, but it too has a distinct flavor and is best used in small quantities as a thickner.  If these flours are not available near you, you can buy them online at http://www.bobsredmill.com/.</p>
