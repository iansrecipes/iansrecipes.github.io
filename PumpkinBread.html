<h1>Pumpkin or Sweet Potato Bread</h1><br>

<ul>
<li>3/4 cup Spectrum safflower oil</li>
<li>1/3 cup water</li>
<li>4 organic brown eggs</li>
<li>2 cups cooked pumpkin or sweet potato (1 can Farmerâ€™s Market organic pumpkin)</li>
<li>1-1/4 cups Wholesome Foods organic cane sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp Redmond's sea salt</li>
<li>1 tsp Simply Organic nutmeg</li>
<li>1 tsp Simply Organic cinnamon</li>
<li>1 cup Bob's Red Mill organic amaranth flour</li>
<li>1 cup Bob's Red Mill organic coconut flour</li>
<li>2/3 cup Bob's Red Mill potato starch</li>
<li>1/3 cup Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour</li>
<li>2 tsp Arm & Hammer baking soda</li>
<li>2 tsp Bob's Red Mill xanthan gum</li>
<li>1 cup organic raisins (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>Combine oil, water, eggs, pumpkin or sweet potato.  Premix sugar, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon and add to wet ingredients (premixing keeps spices from clumping).  Then add amaranth and coconut flour, mix until combined well.  Turn off mixer.  Add potato starch, tapioca flour, baking soda, xanthan gum.  Use rubber spatula to fold these ingredients into batter.  You can turn on mixer for a few moments to combine completely, but batter will become gummy quickly if you mix very long.  Divide batter into 3, greased and amaranth floured, bread pans.  Set bake dial right between 350-375 degrees and bake for about 45 minutes.  Tops of bread should look a bit overdone to ensure that insides are completely cooked.  Remove from pans after about 5 minutes to cool on racks.</p>
